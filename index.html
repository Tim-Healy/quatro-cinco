      <h3>Here are somethings I remember that can go with icons to satisfy the icon project that is coming up.  Still tinkering with it.</h3>

          <div class="bag">
          <img src="images/house.png" alt="Drawing of a house" class="icon">
        <p class="words">This is a house, like the one we used to live in.  Now we live in an apartment building with a flat roof, which is also nice but which looks different.  So this is Icon1.</p>
      </div></div>

        <div class="box">
          <div class="bag">
          <img src="images/ant.png" alt="Drawing of an ant" class="icon">
          <p class="words">We would sometimes see ants in or around the house.  No big deal.  They're small and mostly stayed outside. If they got in the house we would kill 'em.  So this is Icon2.</p>
        </div></div>

        <div class="box">
          <div class="bag">
          <img src="images/cake.png" alt="Drawing of a cake" class="icon">
          <p class="words">I recently had a birthday party. Actually a few of them.  There was usually cake and presents.  Notice I'm not talking about how many candles.  This is Icon3.</p>
        </div></div>

        <div class="box">
          <div class="bag">
          <img src="images/clock.png" alt="Drawing of a clock" class="icon">
          <p class="words">Well, this has been fun but it's time I got back to work and do something more concrete and less theoretical.  Thanks to Daria for the drawings.  This is Icon4.</p>
